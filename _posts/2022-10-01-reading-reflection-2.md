Here is my post.

## Reading Reflection Two

Pocock’s first chapter on Gibbon’s work was quite helpful in understanding Gibbon’s work as an organic whole.  As students of history, we are accustomed to reading a chapter or two of the Decline and Fall as is appropriate for research papers, assignments, etc., but never from start to finish.  Because of this, it is often difficult for students to gain an understanding of who Gibbon actually was, to include his strengths, weaknesses and biases.  Naturally every author (ancient and modern) is incapable of presenting a completely neutral narrative of the events of the past, and Pocock’s observations of Gibbon’s tendencies particularly with regard to his perception of the Christian and Muslim religions are no exception.  
My favorite of Pocock’s observations about Edward Gibbon dealt with the paradigms the latter employed, and how he was somewhat conflicted over whether the paradigm he used to explain the history of the western Roman Empire would be acceptable in explaining the history of the Eastern Roman Empire.  Based on Pocock’s analysis, it appears that Gibbon, while acknowledging that the East would require its own mode of study, was not sure that one such paradigm could be found.  Gibbon’s insistence that history-writing should be driven by models is problematic in and of itself for historiographical reasons.  While patterns may emerge in the study of the past, there are often exceptions to these patterns thereby making much of history the study of the “gray area.”  This is perhaps most clear in Gibbon’s first volume when, very close to the beginning of the first chapter, he discusses the reign of Emperor Hadrian.  

While praising Hadrian and all the emperors of the Nerva-Antonine Dynasty, Gibbon does portray his abilities as less than equal to his predecessors’ (Emperor Trajan) by introducing him as the emperor whose reign must first be measured by his relinquishing of Trajan’s eastern conquests.  Because Gibbon’s paradigm of Roman greatness consisted of a measurement of the area controlled by the emperor, Trajan’s reign marked the height of Roman greatness—an opinion that, despite significant scholarly re-consideration beginning in the late nineteenth century and early twentieth centuries, still survives to some degree.  Ultimately it was Hadrian’s relinquishment of Trajan’s eastern conquests that led Gibbon to judge Trajan as the superior emperor; as I argued in my undergraduate honors thesis, despite this being a simplistic method of evaluation, it has endured with unexpected longevity.  Apart from being incomplete, I would argue that this account of Hadrian’s actions in the eastern part of the empire is manifestly unfair.  While it is true that Hadrian did indeed relinquish Trajan’s conquests in Armenia, Assyria, and parts of Mesopotamia and Dacia, his reign marked the beginning of a period in which the emperor travelled extensively, spent comparatively little time in the capital, and was unprecedentedly attuned to the needs of the Roman provinces—especially in Greece.  

Though helpful in establishing historical baselines and overall characteristics of the different eras of the Roman Empire, Gibbon’s rigid adherence to paradigms in writing the Decline and Fall should always be reviewed for oversimplifications of very complex political situations, individuals, and economic and social processes.
