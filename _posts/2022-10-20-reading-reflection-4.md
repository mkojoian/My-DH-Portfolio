Here is my post.

## Reading Reflection Four

Adam Kirsch’s article, “Technology is Taking over English Departments” was (despite taking a pessimistic view of the Digital Humanities in the classroom) a thought-provoking read.  His criticism that the Digital Humanities are not a clearly defined academic discipline does seem to be somewhat true (and corroborated by the famous “What is Digital Humanities” website in which there are many conflicting definitions of the subject).  I appreciated the analogy of comparing the Digital Humanities to a genus and not a species simply because the ways in which a social scientist uses DH will not be the same way a historian, philosopher, or classicist employs them.  Because of this, it seems fair to conclude that the Digital Humanities are not an academic discipline in the same way Mathematics, Biology, Political Science, and Theology are.  

Despite the many exciting prospects of the Digital Humanities, I can appreciate the issue Stephen Ramsay raises, namely that humanities professors, to include “digital ones,” do not know how to code.  I agree that this is problematic primarily because there are many people who can use computers to accomplish various (sometimes complex) tasks who have no understanding of how computers behave beneath the world of graphical user interface.  People like this may be quite proficient at using computers, sometimes even for the humanities, but this does not make them digital humanists.  

Finally, the questions Kirsch poses pertaining to the feasibility of including coding exercises in the decade-long (at minimum) humanities education are rather interesting.  If the Digital Humanities really are contributing to the degradation of English (and other) departments in that students are no longer expected to memorize material or perform “close readings”—both of which are highly time-consuming—then it would seem that there would be more time to include programming classes in the curricula of these institutions of higher learning.
