Here is my post.

## Reading Reflection Six

The article Digital Humanities @ Pratt by Abigail Walker was a very useful article in breaking down APIs for people who are not thoroughly versed in Computer Science or Digital Humanities.  The different headings coupled with the images with examples on how to locate APIs were also helpful.  By reading this article I learned that APIs (Application Programming Interface) are ways in which software systems communicate with one another.  The GET request is one of the most common ways in which people interact with APIs and apparently occurs even with a simple search on the internet.  A URL (uniform resource locator) is sent to a server which then provides a “human-readable text or data” (Walker, Digital Humanities @ Pratt).  APIs are useful for Digital Humanities because they help provide manageable amounts of data in machine-readable formats such as RDF and JSON (which, as we discussed in class, functions like a Python dictionary).  

Another asset of APIs lies in the fact that they allow a user to retrieve data as long as desirable data (data matching the needs of the user) continues to become available.  As Walker states in her article, an example of this would be a café using APIs to communicate their hours of operation and this information being available on Google Maps.  While businesses and smaller organizations often make use of APIs, larger institutions such as libraries do as well.  Organizations that rely heavily on storing digital resources often use APIs, although there is sometimes the fear that viewers will employ web scraping techniques to rob them of their ideas.  For this reason, discretion is required in using APIs, especially when it would be undesirable or dangerous for people to have open access to certain information.
