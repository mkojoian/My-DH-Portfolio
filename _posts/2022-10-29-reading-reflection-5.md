Here is my post.

## Reading Reflection Five

I chose to upload a pdf of the Declaration of Independence to Voyant Tools.  The first thing
noticed was that the term “lawyer” appeared very prominently in the generated word-cloud.  
This struck me as odd and, after looking around the document, I realized that this particular 
version of the Declaration of Independence identified each of the signers with each of their 
individual professions at the end of the document.  Because so many of the signers were lawyers, 
this accounted for the apparent frequency of a word that is otherwise not mentioned in this 
document.

I also enjoyed looking at the statistics of word usage under the “summary” tab.  Like Microsoft
Word, this feature reports how many words are in a given document, but it also counts the 
number of unique word-forms to give the user an idea of how many words are repeated—in other 
words, this feature will not double-count repeated words.  Using this tool, one can see that the 
word “political” is used only twice which, considering that the Declaration of Independence is 
primarily a political document, is a rather surprising a point of interest that could easily lead to 
multiple research questions.  

I did notice that Voyant Tools interpreted some words incorrectly.  An example would be 
“the unanimous” and “the thirteen” both of which it interpreted as one word units.  I am unsure if 
this is because of the nature of the pdf I uploaded, or if Voyant Tools makes this mistake from 
time to time.  Either way, instances like this make the data and usage statistics slightly skewed.
