Here is my post.

## Reading Reflection Seven

I chose this Rockwell and Sinclair’s Hermeneutica for my final reflection post because of its relevance for digital analysis of text.  I would like to center my final project on digitally analyzing text through treebanking.  The inspiration for this article is the story of Pygmalion form Ovid’s Metamorphoses in which Pygmalion falls in love with a statue of his own creation and Venus brings it to life for him.  Likewise, the novel Galatea 2.2 written by Richard Powers tells of a writer who teaches a computer named Helen to interpret literature with the result of Helen’s suicide and destruction of the program because of “her” distress of not being able to experience the things about which “she” has read.  As Rockwell and Sinclair suggest, Helen’s action implies that “interpretation without experience or agency is bereft” (Rockwell and Sinclair, 25).  After a discussion on how computers interpret strings, the article then turns to tokenization (breaking a larger piece of text into smaller pieces) which can happen at the paragraph, sentence, phrase, or even word level.  Because, as was evident in the story of Helen, computers do not actually understand words or phrases the way humans do, there are many errors that can occur throughout this process.  Examples of difficulties computers encounter in tokenizing include all hyphenated words, contracted words (eg. “don’t” potentially being separated into “don” and “’t”) and the computer including punctuation marks as part of a given word (eg. “word.”) (Rockwell and Sinclair, 33-34).  I have already encountered issues with tokenizing words in the dataset for my final project.  Sometimes multiple words are erroneously strung together as a one-word-unit, other times punctuation such as quotation marks, parentheses, commas, or periods is counted as part of a word instead of being labeled separately as a punctuation mark.  I am not yet sure why this happens in some situations and not others, but it is clear that, although computers are certainly helpful in analyzing text, interpretative issues which can only be corrected by human intelligence remain.
