Here is my post.

## Reading Reflection Three

Professor Crane’s article “Beyond Translation: Language Hacking and Philology” was very helpful in considering the role of translations (particularly of ancient works) and the appropriateness of their roles in education.  I once heard it said that every translation is also, to some degree, a commentary, and it appears that Professor Crane’s work in democratizing ancient texts such as the Homeric epics helps eliminate the extent readers need to rely on translations in order to understand the linguistic phenomena underpinning any given text.

I was particularly interested in section two of the article which discussed the Greek term μῆνις and how this term is used in both the Iliad and the Odyssey to describe divine anger (such as that of Zeus, Apollo, and other unnamed divinities).  Having this word (or, more accurately, an inflected form of it) describe the mortal son of the sea nymph Thetis communicates that this rage is superhuman.  The events recounted in the following books are thus the explicit result of a mortal experiencing a wrath that properly belongs to the gods.  As professor Crane suggested in class, no translation alone would be able to communicate this.  Using the “middle path” however—the path between fluent reading of ancient Greek and total reliance on a translation—affords a reader with little or no familiarity with the Greek language the ability to understand a very important point about the first word in the continuous tradition of European literature (class notes, 10/5/22).
