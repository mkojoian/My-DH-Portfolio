This Programming Historian lesson entitled Manipulating Strings in Python teaches users how to perform basic operations on strings some of which are more intuitive than others.  Using a + sign to concatenate strings is logical as is getting multiple copies of a string with the * sign.  Appending with += is not initially as straightforward, but the symbology does make sense after seeing the result of employing these symbols together.  The len() function is another way of analyzing strings but counts both letters and spaces so this must be figured into the result.  Searching for a substring within a string is one of the more useful ways of manipulating strings and has obvious applications in programs such as Microsoft Word in which a term may be searched within a document.  To ensure that a given term will match the search, it is sometimes necessary to “standardize” the string using the .lower, .upper, or .title methods which we learned in class.  These have important applications when preparing, cleaning, or searching texts that are scraped from a website like Project Gutenberg.  I do not think we ever replaced or sliced letters in a string, but the syntax appears to be much like the process we used to replace items in a list.        
Even though we learned about strings very early in the semester, it seems that they continue to be of great importance and can be applied to a variety of datasets.  An example would be the webscraping lesson Peter gave in which we passed strings through BeautifulSoup after calling a GET request through the requests library.  This is important because without the initial strings, we would never be able to create a dictionary, or by extension, a Pandas DataFrame that can be converted into a CSV file.
