## Brief Description of map. 

The link above is a map I created of places mentioned in Edward Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire chapter one.  I tried to use several of the skills learned during both of Ms. Talmadge’s lectures and mapped the locations both with traditional points as well as thermal mapping.  As recommended, I have organized the points corresponding to the place names mentioned by Gibbon by term frequency.  For additional layers, I added the Roman Empire in 117 AD which was the peak of the empire in terms of area, and occurred under the reign of Emperor Trajan (r. 98-117) as well as the Roman Empire in 200 AD.  The combination of these two layers neatly demonstrates how the empire had shrunk (beginning with the imperium of Emperor Hadrian who reigned from 117-138).  In addition to these broader categories, the blue stars I added are from Pleiades POI and represent “aqueduct groups.”
